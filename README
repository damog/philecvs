phile - php file manager
========================

I really don't know what phile is :-). It was intended for a classical
file manager, but I think there are several excellent projects out there.
Maybe I want to see it as a replacement of a webserver's face, for
displaying the files.

The most common webserver is Apache, and the face for listing files is
ugly. phile could fit in that place: Maybe :)


update.php
==========

There is not official releases of phile: I don't like traditional releases.
Instead, I use a php script called update.php, which you need to run in order
to get phile.

This method brings several nice features:
- It breaks the traditional: url, get, download, unpack, install.
- There are not user mistakes :)

When you run update.php, it looks for an existing phile/ directory in the
current location. If it doesn't exists, the script creates it by
checking out the cvs tree. If it already exists, updates the tree and
make additional stuff, like displaying news or so.

This a first revision of this document, and also, the script. Do not
expect everything to work :)

update.php usage:
$ php update.php


requeriments
============
Note that you'll need php >= 4.3 in order to run update.php (php-cli was
developed for 4.2 but it was useful on 4.3.x). If you don't have a 4.3 php
installation, you can browse manually phile cvs repository. Maybe one day
i'll code a bash script instead of php script for getting phile.
